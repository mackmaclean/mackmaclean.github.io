  <h3>  Tech. Issues </h3>
  <h3> <a href="http://www.touchpoint-resource.com/blog/ultimate-online-toolkit-keeping-technical-skills-date/"> The ultimate online toolkit for keeping your technical skills up-to-date </a> </h3>
<p>
Keeping your knowledge up-to-date is vital in this constantly changing and competitive industry. To help you stay ahead and stand out, we’ve compiled the ultimate online toolkit so you can learn new things, develop existing skills and connect with industry experts.
</p>

<h3>  GitHub </h3>
<p>
GitHub is a collaborative platform for developers. It enables users to publish and share coding projects within a community. This means GitHub also functions as a social networking platform for programmers, allowing them to share their knowledge and show off their skills.
</p>
<h3>  TreeHouse </h3>
<p>
Treehouse is a comprehensive online learning platform. Subscribers have access to classes on markup languages, software such as Adobe Photoshop and programming languages including JavaScript and Objective-C. Business education classes are also available, teaching students how to set up and market their own business.
</p>
<p>
Classes start with the basics and take you all the way through to more complex operations. To give users a sound understanding of the subject, the lessons utilise explanatory videos, interactive challenges and quizzes. Along the way, badges are earned so students can track and show off their progress. Anyone online can see these badges and there have been instances where companies have recruited based on the badges candidates have achieved.
</p>
<p>
Nearly everyone can learn something by signing up to Treehouse – from beginners through to seasoned professionals. Despite the wealth of information available, lesson plans are easy to navigate and clearly outline the skills you’ll be learning. Although you have to pay to subscribe, the platform is still affordable with two payment tiers.
</p>

<h23  Codecademy </h3>
If you are working in the digital sector but not in a technical role, Codecademy is a good way to enhance your skillset. More experienced coders may find it a bit basic, however. In addition, the focus is very much on writing code so the underlying principles are glossed over. For those serious about learning to code, you may want to complement the courses with other resources.
<p>
Codecademy was set up by two friends who wanted to learn code but weren’t satisfied with the learning materials available at the time. Although only offering courses on JavaScript at the start, this online learning platform now teaches a variety of languages including PHP, Ruby and jQuery. There is also the opportunity to pass on your knowledge by teaching a course of your own.
</p>
<p>
Codecademy is free to join and gets you coding straight away. Once you’ve selected a lesson, you’re taken to the learning page. Instructions are displayed on the left, code is entered in the middle and the box on the right demonstrates what it does.
