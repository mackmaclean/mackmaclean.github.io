<!-- This template is in markdown, not html, so
  it will not render beautifully when you copy and
  paste it into your github.io site, but it will at
  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) -->

We are not patrons of a restaurant ordering dishes off a menu.
Instead we want to make wonderful dishes in the kitchen together.

I appreciate the mindset to work on our whole self - mind, body, and soul and to become better as a person, to work well with others, and to be good citizens of the world :).
