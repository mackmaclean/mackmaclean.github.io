<!-- This template is in markdown, not html, so
  it will not render beautifully when you copy and
  paste it into your github.io site, but it will at
  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) -->

#### Version Control, git, and GitHub
#### 9/18/2014

Version Control keeps track of changes to your software projects files and enables you to "roll-back" those changes to a baseline file if needed.

git is an implementation method of version control that we shall use in our coursework.

GitHub is a web based remote storage service used by developers to collaborate and work on projects together in a version control environment.
